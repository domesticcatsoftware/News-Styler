About
-----

News Styler is a basic Safari extension that provides custom CSS for theage.com.au.  It's far from perfect and was created really only to learn how Safari extensions work and to try and make the increasingly bad theage.com.au website more bearable [and to make fun of the comments].

* Removes most ads, cross promotions (use in conjunction with AdBlock/Flash blocker for better coverage)
* Tweaks the visual style somewhat, stripping a lot of the colours and changes the body font
* Removes sidebars and huge footer including horoscopes from most pages (I can't stand horoscopes)
* Moves the main image carousel to the right
* Re-styles the comments
* ...

The style sheet is somewhat commented.  If you want to bring back the two sidebars it's quite easy to do.

Of course as soon as theage.com.au change things it will likely break and I'll have to tweak it.

Todo:
-----

* Make it look a little better
* Prevent home page from auto-reloading
* Prevent auto-play videos from auto-playing
* Add a settings panel to be able to add/remove sections at will
* Extend it across more sections of the website
* Potentially do the same for news.com.au but make the comments even more outrageous
